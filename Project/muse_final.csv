Bow the heart if not the knee Or never again this world you’ll see” “Oh, please let not your heart be cold This man is dearer to me than gold” “Oh, my dear, you must be blind He’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind” “You’ve had your way too long with me Now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be” “Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed ‘You’ll have to try to get past me first” “Do not let your passion rule You think my heart the heart of a fool And you, sir, you can not deny You made a monkey of me, what and for why?” “I’ll have no more of this insulting chat The devil can have you, I’ll see to that Look sharp or step aside Or in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died” The gun went boom and the shot rang clear First bullet grazed his ear Second ball went right straight in And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed It would take more than needle and thread Bleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead “You shot my husband down, you fiend” “Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean? He was a man of strife, a man of sin I cut him down and threw him to the wind” This she said with angry breath “You too shall meet the lord of death It was I who brought your soul to life” Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife His face was hard and caked with sweat His arms ached and his hands were wet “You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife If you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife” “We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot But we’re no way similar in body or thought All husbands are good men, as all wives know” Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow His knees went limp and he reached for the door His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor He whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault My fighting days have come to a halt” She touched his lips and kissed his cheek He tried to speak but his breath was weak “You died for me, now I’ll die for you” She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through All three lovers together in a heap Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep Funeral torches blazed away Through the towns and the villages all night and all day"

"416","Hoogtevrees","Boudewijn de Groot","Niemand te zien, de straat lag verlaten Ik liep er alleen en speelde gitaar Misschien klinkt het vreemd: ik moest componeren En buiten was niemand, daarom deed ik het daar Maar juist door de stilte kon iedereen het horen Ze gingen me volgen, ik was niet meer alleen Ze waren heel aardig, zelfs wat onderdanig En liepen te luisteren. Wat prachtig, zei er een Ik werd vergeleken met de groten der aarde Ze zeiden ook dat het op Paul Simon leek Eerst was ik verrast, toen begon het te hinderen Maar niemand nam aanstoot hoe kwaad ik ook keek Toen zag ik de trap, een wenteltrap naar boven En ik dacht: ""Die neem ik, ik moet naar de top."" En terwijl ik maar doorging met componeren Gevolgd door het groepje besteeg ik de trap En iedereen zuchtte: ""Wat is het toch schitterend Op ieder trede speelt hij een nieuw akkoord."" En hoe goed bedoeld ook ik wilde alleen zijn Maar werd afgeleid bij ieder woord Ik ging sneller lopen terwijl ik bleef spelen Maar ze bleven me volgen: een krankzinnige race Ik keek naar beneden en dacht: ""Ik moet stoppen Straks val ik te pletter."" Ik had hoogtevrees Zo gingen we verder, het publiek en de zanger Betrapt bij het schrijven van nieuw repertoire De trap ging steeds hoger en had vele bochten Maar niemand werd moe en ik liet ze maar En boven gekomen zag ik tafels en stoelen Wit en heel sierlijk op een heel groot terras En over de rand, ver in de diepte, zag ik bossen en velden Waar de stad eerst nog was Genietend van de zon zaten deftig mensen Als op een receptie voor de koningin Maar niemand zei iets, men glimlachte vriendelijk En roerde bezadigd in tonic en gin Mijn moeder zei: ""O is het niet fantastisch: Zoveel akkoorden in een enkel lied."" Ik kreeg het er warm van en dacht: ""Ook dat nog."" Toen zei ik: ""Hé luister, zo gaat het niet Als jullie hier blijven ga ik naar beneden."" Het klonk wat onaardig maar heel zelfbewust ""Ik ga door met schrijven maar dan in mijn eentje Dus ik ga naar beneden, want daar heb ik rust."" Ze knikten begrijpend, maar tot mijn wanhoop Stond iedereen op en liep naar de trap Ik besloot toen te blijven en alleen gelaten Kwam de rust weer terug, viel de hoogtevrees van me af"

Walk the jangling streets of the city Trying to find the buried sun You could drown yourself in jewels Like a thousand other fools While you wander waiting for it to be done And he cries ""Why don't we celebrate? Why don't we celebrate? Love can make you sad Come on, let's drive ourselves mad"" And he's aware How hard it is To kiss the sun and mean it And mean it And he screams ""Why don't we celebrate? Why don't we celebrate? Life can make you sad Come on, let's drive ourselves mad"" Standing on a rock in a river Staring at the rain made one On the surface flashing diamonds Rolling down the twilight canyon And we shall kiss the sun in spite of him So why don't we celebrate? Why don't we celebrate? Why don't we celebrate? Why don't we celebrate? Why don't we celebrate? Why don't we celebrate?"

Als der erste Virtuose in die Tasten des prunkvollen Flugels schmetterte, lehnten sich alle grob und kleingewachsenen Menschen Auf und bedeckten ihr Herz, patriotisch und stolz auf Rachmaninows Tondichtung, mit dem rechten Handrucken. Unbeirrt und stolzgemacht vom Chauvinismus der Menschen I'm Saal legt Zacharias seine Trommel frei und Beginnt loszumaschieren, erst links, dann rechts, entschlossen in seine Trommel zu schlagen. Er durchstobt die riesigen Holzturen und zieht Trommelnd in den Konzertsaal ein. Vor dem Pianisten angehalten - die Geladenen Gaste geizten nicht mit Hochmut und stachen ihn indes mit feurig Roten Blicken - lost er die Trommel aus der wundgeschundenen Lederschleife Und legt sie vor das Klavier. Es war sien letzter Trommelschlag. (Damals War Zacharias 9 Jahre alt.)"

Der August war ein Eichenklotz, ein müder kleiner Klotz Ein stumpfer, toter, matter, bleicher, fahler kleiner Klotz Er wich dem Glanz, dem Raspeltanz, der Schnitzerbubenhand Er hing noch nicht an Fäden und mied den Puppenstand Der Mehmet schnitzte brav und fein den August aus dem Klotz Er schliff den edlen Körper und schnitt Kleider aus dem Stoff Er gab dem August Leben, er zog an seinen Fäden Er lenkte ihn, er hegte ihn, er führte ihn zum Tanz ""Herbei mein Klotz, mein Puppenklotz, du rote Tanzfigur! Du atmest schon, du tänzelst schon, du bettelst um Statur!"" Der August war voll Leben, er mühte seine Fäden Er war ein Held, ein Kamerad, ein Kumpel in Statur!"

Kühn blieb der Leierkastenmann Komisch war sein Gesang Er drehte die Leier ohne Zwang Er machte Humor zum Drang Kühn blieb der Leierkastenmann Komisch war sein Gesang Er drehte die Leier ohne Zwang Er machte Humor zum Drang Als die große Judenhetze einsetzt, wird es für Hohlberg immer schwieriger Sein Ideal vom komisch besetzten Menschentum mit fidelen Klängen Durchzusetzen. Während die Königsberger letzte Briefe kritzeln, versteckte Münzen zählen und über ein nächstes Jahrzehnt ratschlagen, stellt sich Ihm, dem Leierkastenmann, ein barfüßiges Mädchen mit dem indischen Namen ""Tschandravatii"" vor. Das vom Schmutz der Wasserlachen bekleckerte Kind Verehrt das Hohlberggemüt, hüpft und singt vor seinem Kasten, das Dunkelblaue Kleidchen mit beiden Händen hochgehoben, und verwandelt den Puppenfratz August in eine skurrile Tanzfigur. Frühmorgens und so lange Bis die Nacht erwägt, den fröhlich begonnenen Tag mit dunklen, immer dunkler Werdenden Nachttüchern zuzudecken, tanzt das knochige Waisenkind zu Hohlbergs bizarr-komischer Musik. Er leiert und leiert, doch kalte Winter Ziehen hinauf nach Königsberg, und nur noch kranke Bettler und Tote ruhen In der eisigen Stadt. Willens, den ""Krieger"" zu beschämen, bevorzugt Hohlberg Den Winter als Mörder seiner Lieder, seiner Träume und seines Lebens. Als Der Judenfeind die Stadt Königsberg erreicht, zieht der Spielmann stolz Und trunken in den verzweigten Labyrinthgarten nahe dem Marktplatz, um dort Den harten Kampf gegen den russischen Winter, der ob seiner erdrückenden Schneedecken nun endgültig seinem Namen gerecht wurde, zu verlieren Einige Jahre später, nachdem der Leierkastenmann nachweislich aus der Stadt verschwunden war, erzählte sich manch Königsberger die folgende Geschichte: Damals, im strengen Winter 1941, soll ein indisches Mädchen erfroren sein 6 Jahre alt und verliebt in die Geige. Man sagt, das Kind hätte einen Spielmann lachen hören, unten am Graben, in dem künstlich angelegten Labyrinthgarten der Stadt. ""lachen"" wie der Donner donnerte und Sonne in Der Nase kitzelte, ""lachen"" wie es das Mädchen selbst nur allzu gerne tat Barfuß und dem Leierkastenspiel eines Verrückten hörig, war es in den Irrgarten gezogen, dem Gelächter des Leierkastenmannes folgend. Fast Verwegen ob der lauten Mitteilung stiefelte das Kind weiter, ohne je einen Stiefel getragen zu haben. Der Mann lachte und lachte, leierte immer Wieder zwei, dann drei Töne. Immer leiser verstummten sie in den vereisten Schneebrettern, die sich nun nach und nach von den eisig bedeckten Hecken Lösten Man fand das Mädchen dann im Frühjahr danach, als viele Königsberger aus Dem Süden zurückkehrten, um nach ihren Häuserresten zu sehen. Es saß am Boden Die Arme verschränkt, vor sich ein Kopekenstück, das aus einer leeren Handschale fiel. Den Kopf hatte es an einen Leierkasten gewinkelt. Und Dort, wo Schnee schon schmolz, doch Erde noch fern war, ragte die Holzhand einer Feurig roten Marionette hervor. Unter ihr - konnte das ein lachender Toter Gewesen sein? - fand man, die Marionette fest umklammernd, einen jüdischen Musikanten, erfroren und genauso mindestens einen Winter tot Sein Name: Elias Hohlberg, 39 Jahre alt"

The men all painted proud Their words empty and loud Are trying hard to sell my dream And they tell me It's gone They say it's gone The say it's, it's gone Oh, but I can feel it Oh, I wanna feel it I can't let it run away Out my back door I can't let it run away Out my back door If I look out there If I look out there every day I can't let it run away I can't let it run away If I look out there every day"

"652","Valkyrie Daughter","S.J. Tucker","Valhalla is ever receiving As her sons are forever at war But her gates are not barred, as you may have been told To the women and children worth fighting for Time was that a soldier named for Loki had daughters aplenty He reared them up fierce in his pride The fairest had just reached her flowering time When the Norns cut her thread and she died Well, he wouldn't take no for an answer Nor grieve for the rest of his days He set off for the wild, with his tears still a-stream Resolved to petition the Valkyrie For the sake of his child, he would enter this plea: Retrieve her and teach her your ways So he searched and he strove many seasons 'til the gray had come into his beard He returned home to the scorn of his colleagues and friends His wife rejoiced quietly for his folly's end And asked Frigga for strength, that his spirit would mend That he'd not prove as mad as she feared him Well, a soldier is nothing if not full of pride No warrior if not hard and bold So he set off again well before winter's end To the wild, without telling a soul In spite of himself, in the snowdrifts he fell And succumbed to the night and the cold Deep in the sleep of exhaustion The soldier did fall, and he dreamed He found himself walking the world of Niflheim Where things are indeed as grim as they seem His courage held fast, he continued To the hall where the mistress of that realm did dwell There sat Lady Hel, in her fearsome estate He felt his great heart as it skipped a few beats Just the same, he bowed all the way down to her feet And she grudgingly gave him a smile ""I know why you've come here, young soldier,"" she said ""but you may state your case if you please The roads to this realm do not tolerate men Unless they have come to me at their life's end But you've conquered your fears and so it appears Your dreams let you here with great need."" ""I am nothing to you, O my underworld queen But I come for the sake of my child I do not beg her back, thus insulting your lands But my girl deserves better, at much different hands My daughter should ride with the Valkyrie band! I'll do all that I can just to have this fulfilled!"" The gods are no strangers to bargains Traditions with teeth have their time and their place But Hel is the child of the Breaker of Rules And she had this father's measure, written plainly on his face ""For the sake of your child, you will strike me a deal I will speak with the fierce Valkyrie The condition is this, to be sealed with your blood: No matter your valor, your warrior's fate Your place in Valhalla is forfeit this night You will come, in the end, back to me."" The soldier's eyes clouded, but he cut his own palm And signed all his honor away He thanked Lady Hel for her kindness And hoped that her rank would hold sway ""Go now, young man, for your body is cold Your time in my realm draws too near Return to your wife and your children who live Surround them with all of the love you can give They think they have lost you, but they will forgive Get you home, and banish their fears."" The soldier woke, struggled back fully to life And made his way slowly back home Treacherous toil of a way that it was A goddess had sent him back where he belonged And no avalanche would slow him down It's every hand keeps a family strong It's the self who is last to forgive He vowed on that day ne'er again to forget The worth of his loved ones who live This time he was lauded upon his return-- The men gave great shouts and his wife a tearful smile The village turned out for a great merry feast Never again did his warrior colleagues Serve up their scorn. No, they left him in peace For his journey was writ in his eyes Though he held in his heart now a fine tavern tale The soldier did not tell a soul Some truths are too fine to mix in with the ale And he held this one close while so many others were told With no way of knowing his lost daughter's fate He set all his worries to fade And threw all his heart into raising the rest Thus, a fine generation was made The years took their toll, and he took up his cane His family still lit his world But he onced asked a favor of a wandering bard That she write a fine song for his lost little girl One fine afternoon as the summer rolled on And the harvest was just at its start As he worked side by side with his nephews and sons He lost an old war with his heart Never to walk in Valhalla, he thought To find himself deep in Niflheim But a wonder occurred as he opened his eyes There was his daughter, come down from the skies She rode astride with her Valkyrie sisters With joy far too great for the dead who arise He took her small hand, as if for the first time She told him, ""oh, father! Goddesses oft change their minds!"" Valhalla is ever receiving, as her sons are forever at war But her gates are not shut, as you've heard in this tale As was told to a bard by a soldier To the Valkyrie daughters worth fighting for!"

But beneath the tree where Eagle sat Coyote told the tale Of silly hares cavorting In the old country of Wales Raven stared unto the sun And Crow sang awful songs And Rabbit sat a'listening With ears so wondrous long ""Aha!"" The Trickster danced a dance Of joy and vict'ry sweet He laughed a laugh and swooped a swoop And landed at their feet ""Of all here now,"" the Trickster said ""You are the very Beasts!"" And Rabbit said, ""I'm sorry sir But of all, we are the least."" The Trickster smiled and raised a hand And spoke: ""I have a plan The four of you shall help me To teach the heart of Man Raven with your love of light The Sun you'll steal and soon For the gift of warmth I give to man To be the greatest boon And Crow, you silly creature Who sings without a voice Teach man 'bout pride and helping You really have no choice Coyote my friend, together we'll spin Many a tale at night And show man by our naughtiness What really should be right."" At last He turned to Rabbit With a twinkle in his eye ""You'll be my favorite creature And here's the reason why: Your eyes are bright, your feet are swift Your ears hear round the bend But your very simple humbleness Will steal the heart of men Together we shall thwart the pains The gods do throw to earth And turn aside their fiery darts With merriment and mirth And when time comes that men forget The lessons animals render T'will be the humble rabbit That mankind will remember."" And round the Trickster the animals thronged The birds and all the beasts And humbly bowed to the king they found Who thought himself ""the least."""

At sea on a ship in a thunder storm On the very night that Christ was born A sailor heard from overhead A mighty voice cry ""Pan is dead!"" So follow Christ as best you can Pan is dead! Long Live Pan! From the olden days and up through all the years From Arcadia to the stone fields of Inisheer Some say the Gods are just a myth But guess who I've been dancing with The great god Pan is alive!"

Said the commissar From there your own way home But I never got to Kiev We never came back home Train went north to the Taiga We were stripped and marched in file Up the great siberian road For miles and miles and miles and miles Dressed in stripes and tatters In a gulag left to die All because Comrade Stalin was scared that We'd become too westernized! Used to love my country Used to be so young Used to believe that life was The best song ever sung I would have died for my country In 1945 But now only one thing remains But now only one thing remains But now only one thing remains But now only one thing remains The brute will to survive!"

Yes I am here, waging battle with this version of myself I right my wrongs and think how things used to be, yes I do Some kind of violent spring I have to cover my eyes Water chokes the lense spitting up on the sky Rain down in paragraph form Too late and I don't know why I put my legacy first Oh what a reason to die All the hours past, the body pressed to the wall Hear you breath in, breath out sometimes nothing at all Can you still hear me now Oh there's no labor too small Labor run through you, it's just response to a call But I am here, I am here in the center of myself And do you still think about me? Yes I am here waging battle with this version of myself I right my wrongs and think how things used to be, yes I do A celebration coming up I see the rising of dawn Oh, the sun in the scratch of the mirror it starts to blind me Coming up fast when did it start to go wrong? I keep a picture of you on the mantle to remind me Of a time when life used to be so easy, so easy, and so small I want to dance something caustic and real Oh these days we trade the earth for the things that we feel Healing hands never choosing to heal All this time The laws smashed I know you like breaking laws Something you felt, something you've seen We are embodied in between But when you're lost in your right When you are selfish and mean You are the ugliest person that I have ever seen And I hate you, I hate you, yes I really do But I am here, I am here in the center of myself And do you still think about me? Yes I am here, waging battle with this version of myself I right my wrongs and think how things used to be I am here, I am here in the center of myself And do you still think about me? Yes I am here waging battle with this version of myself I bite my tongue and think how things used to be So easy"

It leaves but a state of supplication and deserted expanses An absorption into despair The existence of things cannot enclose The death which it brings to me The existence is itself projected into my death, and it is my death which encloses it Am I deranged?

We had gathered all our forces Called together all the heroes Equipped a hundred swordsmen And a thousand men with crossbows Strengthened by hate and the thirst for the enemies' blood We lay in wait for the season of no light We had seen the frozen mist - we weren't afraid to die And the oaths we had sworn gave a reason to live on A Calm before the Storm (We were) Awaiting the Winter Frost ...And then a storm arose in fury The sky was shattered by lightning... Awaiting the Winter Frost As the sky blackened and the stars turned red The frost greeted us with a cold northern breeze Off with their heads! Off with their fuckin' heads!!! Oh, the time had come... To slaughter the hordes of cowardice And cleanse the North from lies We had gathered all our forces Called together all the heroes Equipped a hundred swordsmen And a thousand men with crossbows We raised our swords Grasped the irons Lifted our bows And chose the arrows The false ones' hordes were put to the sword The strong and the weak, one by one... Their race was slaughtered to the very last man Our bloodfeud was done as their bodies reddened the land Awaiting the Winter Frost The reign of the dark and the cold The spell of pure hate Awaiting the Winter Frost And the heathen peace was found"

Cause I was naked when you said those words But I felt covered in your whispered worship And as you pass out fast on my shoulder I imagine a child Waiting so sad and still for his mom to arrive Did she leave you an orphan In that big brown leather chair Said ""Don't you move a muscle, kid I'll be back in twenty years"" You were scared, you were lonely But you must have been aware Life is a series of callouses This is just another layer So build them up, tough it out Yeah, that's your skin Don't let anyone under there When you said you needed me Did you really need me? Or was it just someone Oh, you'd take anything Am I first on that list of yours? Or am I second or third? So who's that ahead of me, some harlot from Pittsburgh? Or Detroit, Santa Fe, or San Diego? I know you're so alone But how much affection does one guy really need? Did you date a lot in high school Were you always chasing girls? Couldn't you find some young valentine To steal your heart for good? Were you content or contemptible Are your memories pleasant? Or is it a string of endless flings Of bitter resentment? Seems that what you want and what you need Doesn't mean a thing We're just here for the taking When you said you'd hurt me Did you think you'd hurt me? Are you really that cocky? Yeah, what a heartbreaker Well, I've got my armor Yeah, I've been through some battles before And I met your old girlfriend She said ""Baby, don't bother"" She told me you told her you'd hurt her Funny, how familiar So how much of this relationship was rehearsed? Did you act out as a child Were you always crying wolf? Attention starved, you tried too hard Just to get someone to look Now you're the wolf in secondhand clothing I'm the sheep in a pleated skirt It's an awkward form of payback But if it works for you it works It's that I recognize your off-white lies Still I lie beside you And that's what really hurts When you said you'd leave me Why haven't you left me? What are we still doing here So desperate for company? There's a Greyhound on Jackson Street There's an airport in Council Bluffs Hell, there's a car in the driveway Fifty ways to get lost But as I hold you and listen to you sleeping I'm starting to wonder If I really believe that you'll ever really leave Would you leave me an orphan In your big brown leather chair? The one you lugged around From town to town for all these years It's a trophy of your childhood Like a shark tooth or gator skin boots But this one holds you prisoner It holds me prisoner too What we need to set us free Is to let go of each other Let go of everything When I said I loved you It was because I loved you When I said I needed you Well, I really need you Yeah, I guess you hurt me For once you're a man of your word Well, guess what, I'm leaving I can't be your prisoner I can't be your prisoner, oh no I can't be your prisoner, oh no I can't be your prisoner, oh no I can't be your prisoner, oh no I can't be your prisoner, oh no (I can't do it, I won't do it) I can't be your prisoner, oh no (I can't do it, I won't do it) I can't be your prisoner, oh no I can't be your prisoner, oh no I can't be your prisoner, oh no (I can't do it, I won't do it) I can't be your prisoner, oh no (I can't do it, I won't do it) I can't be your prisoner, oh no I can't be your prisoner"

I’m fuckin' done! This is my fuckin' life And I’m livin' it, I’m havin' fun If you really care for me Prove that I need to live carefully!

"1625","Sick 2 Def","Plan B","Cause I'm real sick hearing these pricks talk shit They'll get their throats slit cause they're talking to me like I'm thick And I'm real tired of these bullshit guys They best go hide cause I'm looking for them on the sly Cause I've had it up to here, right up to here Might have to do it 'Reservoir Dogs' style, slice off the ear Cause I've had enough of bredders acting tough Trying to get rough when it's obvious they ain't rough enough I don't just talk the talk I walk it That's why my mouth's always coming out with raw shit My rap style's distorted, like Little Mo getting raped and keeping the baby Instead of getting it aborted Yo I talk morbid just to make you feel awkward Death's a part of life yo you just can't ignore it Especially when I rip out your heart and on my sleeve sport it Like something you think is precious 'cos your dead gran bought it I talk so foul; I talk so coarse. I show no regret; I show no remorse Like a necromanic raping a corpse up the anal passage while contracting genital warts My metaphors are twisted, like that game where you've got to put that Hob-Nob in your gob If you're the last one to come on the biscuit I'm so sadistic so I fantasise about finding my Mum's ex floating in a bathtub with his wrists slit You best ban TV if you want me to stop 'Cos I'm so heavily influenced by the things that I watch It ain't just 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs' It's 'Irréversible', 'Baise-Moi', 'City of God' It's the news on every channel when I turn on the box It's seeing paedophiles singing on Top of the Pops Gary Glitter, Michael *Jackson* On the net Ken Bigley got his neck took off That's some nasty shit and still you wonder why I'm sick When I see this shit and I say exactly what I think That's some nasty shit and still you don't ban it But you ban computer games, something round here really stinks What about cigarettes and alcoholic drinks Or the animal that died just so your wife could wear that mink You're disgraceful like getting caught pissing in the sink A white girl won't suck my dick just because it's pink The last verse is just as bad as the first But compared to the second, yo, it's definitely worse 'Cos this is about a guy getting chauffeured in a hearse Let me do what Nas did and tell this shit in reverse The hearse brings the corpse back to the morgue; The guy from the morgue undresses the corpse; Embalming fluid goes back out; the blood goes back in; Body goes back to hospital where it comes alive again; The medics walk backwards like an Irish dance; Then put the wounded man back in the ambulance; The ambulance's engine turns back on and his lights flash as the siren plays his favourite song The guy goes back to the exact spot they found him and the medics and all the passers-by go back where they came from 'Til eventually no-one surrounds him And the blood pours up him rather than down him The man then falls upwards back on his feet; stumbles towards a dark figure on the other side of the street; He walks into the blade that cut his belly Then he holds his neck which was bleeding already; He removes his hand so that you can see the cut; And as the knife undoes the slice it closes back up; He unsays the words he said which were 'What the fuck?' And unscreams the scream from the first initial cut Then the blood from his severely severed ear crawls back up his cheek and slowly disappears As the knife-wielding silhouette unhacks it from the rear Puts the knife away after reattaching the ear Then walks backwards thought the bushes where he's just regarding nature; Leaves the guy on a bench un-reading his paper; Takes the snail he stepped on back from its creator; Only to be killed again when I fast-forward this shit later Back in his house now back in his bed He un-listens to a CD and un-bops his head; Takes the CD out the player and puts it back in its case which has my name on the cover along with my face Fast-forward there's been a murder and the police know who done it They're looking for a motive 'cos they don't know why he done it Sure enough it don't take that long for them to find a reason and they publicly state it on TV that evening A couple of months later this shit gets banned Like it was me who put that switch in his hand and told him to kill that man Like this whole song was some kind of sickly devised plan to hurt some poor cunt I don't even know And I've never met before in my life Who it was whoever said 'the pen is mightier than the sword' was right so you'd better think twice before you step to me and pick a fight"

Right after Jon Lennon died, we should've gotten the Partridge Family bus and driven around and killed them all one by one, you know? Elvis Presley should have been shot in the head back in 1957. Somebody should've walked up behind Elvis in '57 with a .44 magnum, put the barrel of the gun right up to his brainstem and just pulled the trigger... so you can remember Elvis in a nice way, eh?

He was found in the toilet... with his pants around his ankles and his big fat hairy sweaty King of Rock and Roll ass exposed to the world, and his final piece of kingly evidence floating in the toilet behind him! Ugh! Creepy! One of his aides had to walk in and go, ""Dang, Elvis is dead. I'd better flush the toilet. (flush) Oh, man! I should've saved that! I coulda made some money off that! Dang, man! A ding dang doo!"" That's why I'm glad Jesus died when he did. Oh yeah. Because if he lived to be forty, he would've ended up like Elvis, come on! Oh yeah, he had that big entourage. Twelve guys willing to do whatever he wanted to do. He was famous already at that point. If he lived to be forty, he'd be walking around Jerusalem with a big fat beer gut and black side burns going, (in Elvis voice) ""Damn, I'm the son of God. Gimme me a cheeseburger and french fries right now. Where's Mary Magdelene, I want a blow job now. Come on now! Fuck you, I'll turn you into a leper! Give me a cheeseburger now, goddammn it. Bluhah.

And you're all coming with me! And don't try to get out of it. ""We didn't laugh at that bit, Jesus, please!"" ""Shut up! Get on the bus with Leary and Scorsese. You're going right to fucking Hell!"" And you know what Hell is, folks. It's Andy Gibb, singing ""Shadow Dancing,"" for eons and eons. And you have to wear orange plaid bell bottoms and sit next to the Bay City Rollers. ""How you guys doing? This is gonna suck!"" I was reading an interview with Keith Richards in a magazine and in the interview Keith Richards intimated that kids should not do drugs. Keith Richards... says that kids should not do drugs. Keith, we can't do any more drugs because you already fucking did them all, all right? There's none left! We have to wait 'til you die and smoke your ashes! Jesus Christ! Talk about the pot and the fuckin' kettle!"

But wait, you never knew what was at stake Creative control they withhold, you sell your soul When you sign on the dotted line hoping to go gold But you'll never see that, not without promotion The label just throw your shit out and got it floatin' You think your shit is potent, but ain't nobody buying it If they ain't never heard of it, ain't nobody trying it If they ain't never heard of it, your record, they murder it You could complain, but they are not concerned a bit 'Cause when they signed you, they thought you'd make a hit 'Cause of who you was affiliated with and all that bullshit Frustrations, all these rules and regulations Just so you can have your shit heard by the nation, and be patient 'Cause by the time they finally release your shit, it's ancient You think they're working your album? You're mistaken And if you flop, you get dropped 'Cause you ain't the star, you didn't go pop Just straight up hip-hop, time to get a mop 'Cause without no promotion, of course sales drop (Damn) Peep the breakdown: If tapes cost ten You'll probably only get to see a dollar in the end That you cannot spend 'cause your budget gets recouped So you never get cash unless your record is ""Shoop."" You better hope you get shows, which will not happen If you don't have a record that's the main attraction Even if you sell a million, you'll get burned 'Cause they keep half your cash just in case of returns For a while, you wonder why rappers don't smile 'Cause to them, you're not an artist, you're just another file Another nigga used to make another buck, they don't give a fuck And if your shit don't blow up — tough But the star gets both promotion and devotion From the whole fucking staff — at you, they laugh The star probably don't know that he the house nigga Thinking he bigger 'cause he the, pick of the litter These labels think backwards They push the acts that need it the least So they can get all the money they can when it's released They take you to a restaurant for a feast And then expect you to pick up the check? That's why I give props to niggas who is independent 'Cause they make they own money, plus decide how to spend it Splendid — let's end it — and don't get offended Slavemaster watching over you Always tryna tell you what the fuck to do The slavemaster watching over you But ain't nothing gonna stop me or my crew Yeah, the slavemaster watching over you Always tryna tell you what the fuck to do The slavemaster watching over you But ain't nothing gonna stop me or my crew Hieroglyphics"

Oh my god, I have this! Write this down. Whatever it is, I have it Half the time I don't even know what the commercial is: There's people running in fields or flying kites or swimming in the ocean Like: ""That is the greatest disease ever. How do you get that? That disease comes with a hot chick and a puppy."" The schools now: It is all about self-esteem in the schools Build the kids' self-esteem, make them feel good about themselves If everybody grows up with high self-esteem, who is going to dance in our strip clubs?

"2940","The Great American Novel","Larry Norman","I was born and raised an orphan in a land that once was free In a land that poured its love out on the moon; And I grew up in the shadows of your silos filled with grain But you never helped to fill my empty spoon And when I was ten you murdered law with courtroom politics And you learned to make a lie sound just like truth; But I know you better now and I don't fall for all your tricks And you've lost the one advantage of my youth You kill a black man at midnight just for talking to your daughter Then you make his wife your mistress and you leave her without water; And the sheet you wear upon your face is the sheet your children sleep on At every meal you say a prayer; you don't believe but still you keep on And your money says in God we trust But it's against the law to pray in school; You say we beat the Russians to the moon And I say you starved your children to do it You are far across the ocean but the war is not your own And while you're winning theirs, you're gonna lose the one at home; Do you really think the only way to bring about the peace Is to sacrifice your children and kill all your enemies? The politicians all make speeches while the news men all take note And they exaggerate the issues as they shove them down our throats; Is it really up to them whether this country sinks or floats? Well I wonder who would lead us if none of us would vote Well my phone is tapped and my lips are chapped from whispering through the fence You know every move I make, or is that just coincidence? Well you try to make my way of life a little less like jail If I promise to make tapes and slides and send them through the mail And your money says in God we trust But it's against the law to pray in school; You say we beat the Russians to the moon And I say you starved your children to do it You say all men are equal, all men are brothers Then why are the rich more equal than others? Don't ask me for the answer, I've only got one: That a man leaves his darkness when he follows the Son"
